glf = general letter frequency:
	only has one number attached to each letter
	this counts the number of letters across the entire word
	counts are dividided by: length of word * number of words

	ex: apple -> counts 1 'a',	 2 'p',	 1 'l',	 1 'e'
	then adds them to the frequency array [a+=1 ... e+=1, ...l+=1, ...p+=2, ...]

slf = spot letter frequency:
	has 5 numbers attached to each letter because it counts per spot
	counts are dividided by: length of word * number of words

	ex: apple -> counts 1 'a',	 2 'p',	 1 'l',	 1 'e'
	it adds 'a' to freq arr spot 1 [a+=1, ...]
	it adds 'p' to freq arr spot 2 [..., p+=1, ...]
	it adds 'p' to freq arr spot 3 [..., p+=1, ...]
	it adds 'l' to freq arr spot 4 [..., l+=1, ...]
	it adds 'e' to freq arr spot 5 [..., e+=1, ...]

wlf = word letter frequency:
	has 1 number attached to each letter
	counts are divided by: number of words

	ex: apple -> counts 1 'a',	 1 'p',	 1 'l',	 1 'e'
	then adds them to the frequency array [a+=1 ... e+=1, ...l+=1, ...p+=1, ...]

	it only counts unique letters in a word
