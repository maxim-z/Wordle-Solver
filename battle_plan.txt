Word lists:

1. Still need to find all the guessable words list. Or make our own.
Done

2. The solution list is finalized as I got it from the source code
of New York Times.
Done

Starting Word:

1. From all of the research we have done try out all the words
and see which ones work best.
- raise, clout, nymph from Seedling
- rance from OptimalWordSolutions
- arose from StatisticalWord
- raise from Auto-solver
- bowne, slaty, prick, faugh, meved from HumanStrategy
- soare, roate from HumanStrategy
- slate, sauce, slice, shale, saute, share, sooty from Solver
- reais from Solver
- tares from WinningWordleWisely


2. Based on the frequencies we have got determine our own best
starting words and see if they differ.

3. Come up with something a little more complex than just the
frequencies? But what?

4. Try random starting words?

Scores:

1. Hypothetical Scores
2. Based on frequency
3. 

Strategies:

1. Go deep by eliminating as many possible words off the start?
2. Breadth by eliminating the most amount of letters and guessing from there?
3. Mix of the first two gather information then go deep.

Algorithm:

1. Reinforcement learning
2. MRD or GEP from WinningWordleWisely
3. 

Potential Questions to answer:

1. Is using just the solution list for guesses better than using the
entire guessable word list?
2.
